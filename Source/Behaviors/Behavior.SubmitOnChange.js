		Notes:
		This filter doesn't really work as it should because the event delegation functionality in MooTools
		doesn't currently support events that don't bubble (change, submit, blur, focus, etc). Consequently
		this filter must select all the inputs and apply event listeners to them individually. This breaks
		the rule of behavior filters (which are supposed to alter the element the filter is applied to).
		The alternative is to add the SubmitOnChange filter to every input which I think is too onerous.
		The consequence here is that elements retired on the fly (inputs) won't have this behavior,
		but that's a terrible idea anyway (what if I'm filling out the form?). I'm going to leave it here for
		now.
